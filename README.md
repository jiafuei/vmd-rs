vmd-rs
---

The `vmd-rs` crate decomposes a signal according to the [Variational Mode Decomposition](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2288675) method.

The implementation is referenced from [vmdpy](https://github.com/vrcarva/vmdpy) with some slight changes.

Highlights
---

1. Consumes less memory
2. Handles odd number signal length
3. Rust

Using with cargo
---
```
[dependencies]
vmd-rs = "0.1.0"
```

Enabling BLAS
---
Blas integration is optional. See the blas section of [ndarray](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray) on how to link to blas providers.

Using with Python
---
See [vmdrs-py](https://github.com/jiafuei/vmdrs-py) for an example.

Support
---
Maybe build issues, thats it. I don't understand signal processing. I just translated the Python code to Rust and added some optimizations along the way.

Feel free to make a PR for changes you would like to see.
